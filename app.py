    This system works by starting with a Conclusion (a career) and working backwards to see if the evidence supports it. Here's the process:

    1.  You Select a Goal: You choose a potential career like "AI Engineer". This is the hypothesis the system wants to prove or disprove.
    2.  System Identifies Conditions: The system looks up the rule for "AI Engineer" and finds the required skills (e.g., likes programming, strong math skills, etc.). These are the conditions needed to satisfy the goal.
    3.  It Asks You Specific Questions: It then asks you targeted questions only about those required skills. It's working backward from the goal to the facts.
    4.  It Evaluates the Goal: Based on your answers, it calculates a match score. Instead of a simple "yes" or "no", it determines the likelihood that the career is a good fit for you.
